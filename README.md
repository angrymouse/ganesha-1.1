# Ganesha
 Ganesha, indian god of wisdom and prosperity. Although Ganesha has many attributes, he is readily identified by his elephant head.

 Also Ganesha is lite gateway for [arweave](https://arweave.org), without deep data caching and things like that. It requires much less resources than [ar.io gateway](https://github.com/ar-io/arweave-gateway) or even [vartex](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/vartex). But requires very great internet channel (works well with 1 GBPS).
